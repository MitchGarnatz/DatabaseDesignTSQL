This repository contains a file titled Assignment8.sql that is a collection of sql statements to create a relational database. For this I made use of setting primary and foreign keys for each table, so the tables relate to one another. Also in this repository is a file titled Assignment8ER_FINAL.PNG which displays the entity-relationship model that is being created. The visualization helps to show where primary keys are mapping and what types of entities are in the database.

Instructions for running code:
- Download Microsoft SQL Sever Management Studio 18
- Download and open the file titled Assignment8.sql
- Run the file and the database will be created
